        <div>
          <p style="font-size: 17px;">I hail from Park Ridge, New Jersey, a small town in Bergen County. The transition from such a small school district to something as large as Stony Brook University was something very eye-opening for me, and very intimidating as well. I was very
            lucky to start my college experience off with the Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band. For example, I started my Fall 2016 semester knowing only that one other person from Park Ridge attended this university, and since then, I've developed
            a phenomenal network of friends (mainly members in the drum-line and computer science communities). They've seen me at my best and my worst, and I'm happy to have them at my back.</p>

        </div>

        <p style="font-size: 17px;"> Before becoming heavily interested and invested in Computer Science and Mathematics, I initially had the intention to attend college for music, as I've been playing percussion since 2007. That endeavor ended for two reasons: One of them was because
          I stumbled upon an introductory programming class and instantly fell in love with it; the other was because, at the time, I thought I'd be going to school for something that I already know how to do. In addition. Luckily at Stony Brook University,
          I can keep both my love of music and my love of programming and Computer Science.</p>

        <br></br>


        <p style="font-size: 17px;"> Outside of academia and drumming, I practice Tae-Kwon-Do, a Korean martial art, and have been since 2004. I have kept a steady pace towards bettering myself in the art. It's changed for me over the years, starting out as something that looked
          cool while watching television to a way to better myself as a person, teach me discipline, etc. Through this way of thinking and acting, I have progressed to a 4th degree black belt (the rank of "Master"), and at this rank, I have gained enough
          knowledge to be able to teach other students the theory and concepts of Tae-Kwon-Do, which I do when I'm at home for a break or for the summer. It's teachings are really applicable to many other aspects of life, which is pretty cool as well.</p>
